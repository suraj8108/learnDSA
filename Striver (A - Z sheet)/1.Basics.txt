		Pallindrome - Code
			- Number that remains same even if reversed. Eg: 121, 1331
		
		GCD / HCF - Code
			https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-to-find-gcd-or-hcf-of-two-numbers/
			
			- GCD or HCF
				GCD of two number is the largest number that divides both of them.
			
			- Find Using Eucladian Algorithm:
					GCD of two number never change if the smaller number is subtracted by the bigger number.
					Pseudo-code:
						gcd(a, b):
							if a = b:
								return a
							if a > b:
								return gcd(a – b, b)
							else:
								return gcd(a, b – a)
			
		Armstrong Number - Code
			- An Armstrong number is a special kind of number in math. 
			- It's a number that equals the sum of its digits, each raised to a power.
			
		Prime - Code
			- Approach1
				Simplest way is to loop from 1 to n and check if any element apart from 1 or n
				O(n)
			- Another approach would be to loop only till n/2 or sqrt(n)
		
		Recursion - Code
			- Pallindrome Added

Step3:
	Sorting Techniques
		1. Selection Sort - Code(SelectionSort)
			https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort-algorithm-2/
						___Sorted Element___Unsorted Element___
				- Select an minimum element from an unsorted array and place it at the first index of unsorted array.
				- Time Complexity O(n^2) and O(1) space complexity.
				- Could be a simple algorithm if memory writes are costly.
				- Not stable algorithm (does not preservs the relative order of items with equal keys)
				- Best Case: In every case element will be searched till the last element of an array but swap will be minimized. 
				
		2. Insertion Sort - Code
			https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort-algorithm/
			
				- Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position 
				  in a sorted portion of the list
				- Best Case - O(n) List is already sorted	| Average Case - O(n^2)
				- Stable algorithm
				- It can parallely be used to sort an element with other sorting algorithms like merge sort or quick sort when the size of subarray becomes small
				- Inplace sorting Algorithm (do not require any extra space to sort an algorithm)
		
		3. Bubble Sort - Code
			https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort-algorithm/g
				- Repeatedly swap and element with the adjacent element if they are in wrong order.
				- Not suitable for large dataset
				- Stable and inplace algorithm
				- Best Case Time Complexity O(n)	| Worst Case Time Complexity O(n^2)
		
		4. Merge Sort - Code
			https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/
				- Divide and Conquer Rule.
				- Recursively divides the input array into smaller sub arrays and sorting those subarrays then merging back together to obtain the sorted array.
				- T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n
				- Best, Worst, Average Case => O(nlogn)
				- Advantages
					- Sorting Large dataset
					- Arrays.sort in Java uses Merge sort implementation
					- Used in TimSort an hybrid algorithm
				- DisAdvantages
					- Not inplace algorithm
					- Space Complexity
			
		5. Quick Sort - Code
			https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort-algorithm/
				- Divide and Conquer Algorithm
				- Picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot in its correct position in sorted array.
				- Choosing Pivot element
					- We have freedom to choose any element as pivot first, last, mid any.
				- Partition -> Will keep smaller element at the left and larger element at right of the pivot
				- Best Case -> O(nlogn) => Occurs when the pivot element divides the array into two equal halves.
				- Worst Case -> O(n^2) 	=> Occurs when smalles or larges element is always choosen as the pivot element.
				- Advantages	
					- Efficient on large data set
					- Cache fiendly as no new array is required to sort so less memory consumption.
				- DisAdvantages
					- Not a good for small dataset also worst case time complexity is O(n^2)
					- Not a stable sort
				- Application
					- Used in partioning problems like finding the kth smallest element
					- Used in Cryptography to generate a random encryption keys
		7. TimSort
				- Mixture of Insertion Sort and Merge Sort
				- This creates a run of limited size and performs insertion sort on that and then merges using mergesort.
