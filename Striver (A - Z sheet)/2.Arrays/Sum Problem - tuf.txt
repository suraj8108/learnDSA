Three Sums Problem:

https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/3-sum-find-triplets-that-add-up-to-a-zero/

	There are two ways to achieve this
		1. Hashing
			-> In this technique we need to loop twice on an array and find all the sum of two numbers and check if thid element is present in the array.
		
		2. Two Pointer Technique
			-> Sort an array
			-> Loop all the element of an array and find the pair of elements from the same array to check sum matches with that element or not.

	Same approach is being used.
