Approaches
	1. Hashing - O(n) / O(n)
		Track each element and find the missing and repeating element from the List
	
	2. Summation Technique
		arr = {4,3,6,2,1,1}			-> expectArr = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
		
		Find the sum of arr and expectArr from the list.
		X = Repeating Element
		Y = Missing element
		
		Sum of arr - Sum of expectArr = X - Y
		Sn = X - Y			--->  Eq1
		
		Sum of squares of element of arr - Sum of Squares of element of expectArr = X^2 - Y^2
		S2n = (X + Y)*(X - Y)
		S2n = Sn(X + Y)		
		X + y = S2n / Sn	---> Eq2
		
		X - Y = Sn			---> Eq1
		
		Use this equation to find the missing and repeating element
