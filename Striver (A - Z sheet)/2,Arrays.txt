Array Problem Tricks

Summation Technique:
	-> An array containing a series from 1 to N then we can use n*(n + 1) / 2 logic to resolve the issue.

Multiplication Technique:
	-> Array containing pair of identical element then a square related operation can be performed.

XOR of a number
	-> XOR operations gives output true only when inputs are different else it output false.
	-> Note: XOR of two same number results is 000000;
	
Two Pointer Technique / Sliding Window
	-> Traversing with two pointers till the end until the right pointer reaches the last index of an array.
	
Three Pointer Technique
	-> Similar but with three pointers in it.

Majority of element:
	-> Morees Voting Algoithm => 
		Mojority of an element can be found out with the help of voting.

Kadane's Algorithm : Maximum Subarray Sum in an Array
	-> 

Prefix Sums Subarray
	-> Create a prefix sums of an array but while finding an element find it based on (x-k) terms.
